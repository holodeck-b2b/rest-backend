# Holodeck B2B REST back-end integration
An extension for Holodeck B2B that implements the _Submit_, _Notify_ and _Deliver_ operations using a REST API. The message meta-data are included in the HTTP headers and the payload of _User Messages_ as entity body. For simplicity and as it is a very common use-case this implementation only supports _User Messages_ with a single payload.

## Installation
### Prerequisites  
This extension requires that you have already deployed Holodeck B2B version 6.0.0 or later and the [*"rest-no-error-content"* Axis2 module](https://github.com/holodeck-b2b/axis2-rest-status-only-error).

### Installation and Configuration
First step is to build the extension or download the latest release. You should now have the `rest-backend-«version».jar` and `hb2b-rest-backend.aar` files available. Copy the jar file to the `lib` directory of the Holodeck B2B instance and copy the aar file to the `repository/services` directory to enable the REST interface in the Holodeck B2B instance. Please note that you cannot activate the extension in a running Holodeck B2B instance and will need to restart the server to activate the REST extension.

No additional configuration is needed for the _Submit_ operation. The _Delivery_ and _Notify_ operations are configured in the
P-Modes by setting the _delivery method_. To use this REST back-end integration set the applicable `DeliveryMethod` element to `org.holodeckb2b.backend.rest.NotifyAndDeliverOperation` and configure its parameters:
1. _URL_ : the URL where the REST service is hosted by the back-end application. As explained above "/deliver" will be added
 to this URL when delivering _User Messages_ and for "/notify/receipt" and "/notify/error" for notification of _Receipt_ respectively _Error_ Signals.
2. _TIMEOUT_ : the time (in milliseconds) the delivery method should wait for the back-end system to accept the delivery and notification. This parameter is optional and when not specified a default timeout of 10 seconds will be used.
3. _SIGNAL_WITH_CONVID_ : indicates whether the <i>ConversationId</i> of the User Message referenced by the notified Signal Message should be included in the notification to the back-end system. This is an optional parameter and when not specified the ConversationId will not be included.

## API Specification
For a full description how the operations are implemented see the [API Specification page](api_specification.md).

## Contributing
